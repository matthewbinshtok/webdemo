       Spotify Playlist Policy

     <h1> Artists Have Their Say... </h1>
     <p>
          The policy was met with sharp criticism from the music industry.
          Many notable artists spoke out for or against the Swedish music-streaming
          service's new policy. Some artists have a lot to lose through this
          policy. This page covers both.

                    Spotify will walk back the streaming service's decision to
                    remove artists accused of misconduct, namely the rapper XXXTentacion,
                    from its featured playlists.

                    Under new "public hate content and hateful conduct policy,"
                    Spotify will not promote acts that "don't reflect values"
                    Following additional allegations against R. Kelly, numerous
                    streaming services "muted" that singer's music from their
                    respective spotlighted playlists, with Spotify taking the
                    extra step of also removing XXXTentacion, the chart-topping
                    rapper who was previously charged with battering a pregnant
                    woman.

                    While Spotify's move was applauded in some circles,
                    the policy also fueled censorship concerns. "Whoa. Are they
                    censoring the music? Thatâ€™s dangerous," Top Dawg Entertainment
                    president Punch tweeted. A representative for Kendrick Lamar,
                    a TDE rapper, reportedly called Spotify CEO Daniel Ek to
                    "express their frustration" over the policy, Bloomberg reports.
                    Spotify's industry liaison Troy Carter also reportedly threatened
                    to leave the streaming service if the policy wasn't revised.
               </p>
               <p>
                    Following Spotify's new anti-hate policy, XXXTentacion's
                    manager provided a long list of artists with checkered pasts
                    and criminal allegations that were not punished by the
                    streaming services. The policy has also been employed to
                    expel white nationalist "hate bands" from the streaming
                    service. As the Associated Press reported, after Kelly was
                    taken off of streaming services' playlists (but not the
                    services themselves), the singer actually saw an uptick in
                    his streaming numbers in the week following the removal.
                    Bloomberg notes that, despite restoring XXXTentacion's
                    playlist placement, Spotify has no plans to promote Kelly again.
